						China seems to have a game plan, something up its sleeve when it is dealing with African countries. But the African nations are unaware of it. They seem to have been hypnotized by the dragon and are taking the bait.
					</p>

					<p>
						And this is how Lamisi Dabire, a PR practitioner in Accra sees it. “While the Chinese are bringing in some investments into our economy; I strongly believe they will hurt us in the end. Take road construction for example in Accra, I am yet to see any site without the Chinese.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Dabire also has a bigger fear and suspicion. “They are all over supervising construction jobs. It is not the case that we lack the human resource, but for some very strange reasons more contracts are going to the China Construction Company. My biggest concern is their business value, I am not sure they have any. All they are concerned about is making profits; they allegedly bribe their way through the system and will get involved in all sorts of illegal deals just to make money.”
					</p>
					<p>
						While most African countries have had bilateral relations with China for more than 50 years, China’s economic support to them was not substantial until recently. For instance, China has provided a significant amount of support to Ghana’s health, energy sector and agriculture sectors since the 1960s. In 2010 China provided an interest-free loan of $20 million to Ghana for the construction of a fishing landing site in the Central Region.
					</p>

					<p>
						China and Guinea established diplomatic relations on October 14, 1959, making Guinea the first African country to establish diplomatic relations with China. China has subsequently provided Guinea with aid to build a presidential palace and hydropower stations among others.
					</p>

					<p>
						In September 1960 the two countries signed an agreement on trade and payment. In 2002 the trade between China and Guinea reached $54.91 million with Chinese exports at $43.38 million and imports at $11.53 million.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Most African countries found that China offered them more advantageous deals compared to the ones offered by western nations. China demanded fewer conditions when it provided assistance, granted loans at very low interest rates and long repayment periods.
					</p>
					
				</p> The Chinese offer assistance in trade, foreign direct investment, loans and grants, and sometimes military.

						China provided assistance to African countries based on political factors, giving high priority to highly visible, prestige projects such as stadiums, roads and hospitals. China also financed the construction of a couple of railway lines.
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition, China played a significant role in providing military support to the governments of some African countries.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) there is widespread evidence that China has transferred armaments to several African states, such as Chad, Ethiopia, Gabon, Namibia and Nigeria.<sup> </sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						<sup> </sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Peter Wezeman, author of the SIPRI report has reportedly said, “Africa is quite an important market for the Chinese arms industry because it is a stepping stone to becoming a first-tier arms exporter.”<sup> </sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						The report notes that China’s involvement in Africa can guarantee several advantages since the competition of Western companies is low and China can present itself as a reliable supplier that doesn’t make the sale of weapons dependant on the respect of human rights. In addition, China is able to offer “friendship pricing” and very favorable financing options, the report added.
					</p>

					<p>
						Zambia’s late president, Levy Mwanawasa, reportedly said at the African Business Forum in Washington DC, USA in 2007: “We only turned to the East when you people in the West let us down. ….Give us the same or more cooperation than what we are getting from China, and you will see that we are friends. … The good thing is that I know no strings are attached to Chinese investment.”

						Several Chinese banks have thrown their support behind China’s strategy of pursuing bilateral relations with African countries. They include the China Exim Bank which was established in 1994 to promote Chinese exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the infrastructure sector in the form of roads, power plants, pipelines and telecommunications.
					</p>

					<p>
						By 2012, China’s Exim Bank became the largest single financier in Africa. According to ratings agency Fitch, about $67.2 billion of its loans between 2001 and 2010 were issued for African infrastructure projects. That was much more than the World Bank's $54.7 billion in loans for African infrastructure projects during the same period. A World Bank report in 2009 estimated that Chinese financial commitments to such projects rose from less than $1 billion annually in 2001-2003 to around $1.5 billion annually in 2004-2005, and reached at least $7 billion in 2006. In July 2012, Chinese President Hu Jintao offered $20 billion in loans to African countries over the next three years. (The World Bank) The estimate for total Chinese investment in Africa from 2010 to 2012 is $101 billion.
					</p>

					<p>
						The China Development Bank (CDB), also established in 1994, has provided loans to Chinese firms. It launched the China-Africa Development Fund to support Chinese FDI in Africa. Since 2001, SINOSURE (China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation) has provided insurance against the risks involved in Chinese exports and foreign investment.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, China’s FDI in Africa has increased 46% annually during the last decade. Total foreign investment stood at $4.46 billion in 2007 compared to $56 million in 1996. During the first half of 2009, Chinese FDI flows into Africa increased by 81% compared to the same period in 2008, reaching more than $500 million.
					</p>

					<p>
						However, it is difficult to be certain about the level of China’s FDI outflows, because estimates from different sources vary widely, and Chinese investments are often channeled through offshore entities registered in places such as Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands. It is also unclear what China’s motives are in these dealings, because some of its promises to some African countries have not been fulfilled.
					</p>

					<p>
						Franklin Cudjoe, who heads IMANI Ghana, a think tank in Accra, believes the China-Africa issue has not been addressed adequately.
					</p>

					<p>
						“The China question in Africa has not been effectively dealt with by individual African countries,” he said. “There is nothing like an African strategy to deal with China. There ought not to be one at all.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Instead Cudjoe suggests that Africans should make an effort to understand exactly what China wants in each of their countries.
					</p>

					<p>
						“There must only be an understanding of what China wants in each African country and negotiating as such,” he said. “Dealing with the Chinese first in terms of origin of most cheap products has meant that there has been a regular supply of varied products for different income groups which has had less of an impact on meager incomes earned in most African countries.”

						Since the discovery of oil in Ghana in 2007, China has stepped up its relations with that country. In the same year, the Chinese gave Ghana a grant of $5 million to construct its $6.75 million Ministry of Defense Headquarters in Accra, the Ghana government provided the counterpart funding of $1.75 million. China is also investing in the construction of the Bui Hydroelectric Dam, a collaborative project between the government of Ghana and the Chinese construction company Sino Hydro.
					</p>

					<p>
						The total cost of the dam is estimated at $622 million. The Ghana government will provide $60 million and the Eximbank of China is providing $562 million made up of a concessionary loan of $268.5 million and a buyer’s credit loan of $293.5 million.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Chinese are also investing in the airline industry. In 2012, China invested in a new Ghanaian airline that serves domestic routes, and it is likely that China Airports Construction Corporation (CACC) will be involved in building Accra’s new international airport.

					<p>
						Despite all this, Cudjoe believes that there is little understanding of China’s political interests in African countries.
					</p>

					<p>
						“On the political front, our inability to understand the Chinese has led to several disappointments in loan arrangements for key infrastructure projects,” he said, citing what he called an “ill-fated” $3 billion loan deal that the China Development Bank signed with Ghana in 2009.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Ghana banked all her hopes for infrastructural projects on that single loan, yet did little homework in terms of profitability and viability of the project in order to draw down all the funds the project contemplated,” Cudjoe said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Although the loan has not yet been fully issued, Ghana has been paying interest and management fees since 2009.
					</p>

					<p>
						Cudjoe also argues that even in cases where some of this Chinese assistance has resulted in some projects, the Chinese bring in its own citizens to execute them.
					</p>

					<p>
						“In any case, where these relationships have translated into some project delivery, there is an army of Chinese involvement that is no different from the western type of aid though, except that the Chinese workforce that accompanies such projects is unskilled and in some cases causes rifts in local communities,” Cudjoe said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Cudjoe believes Chinese involvement in Ghana’s mining sector hasn’t been good for the African country.
					</p>

					<p>
						“On the mining front, our inability to regulate and effectively decentralize the mineral’s rights regime has resulted in collaborations between poorly resourced small-scale miners and ‘wealthy’ Chinese miners who team up to carelessly mine minerals and leave in their wake environmental poverty,” he said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yidana Hamid, a documentary filmmaker, criticizes the Chinese for how they treat Africans who live around illegal mines, which he witnessed when he went on location to the Amansie West District in Ghana’s Ashanti Region to film a documentary for the BBC.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Farmlands have been sold to the Chinese who were doing illegal mining,” he said. “But beyond that, what we saw was scary—Chinese workers openly wielding guns to ward off locals. One local resident who showed us the site wouldn’t go with us because he was afraid he would be shot.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Dabere was unhappy with Chinese involvement in the mining sector.
					</p>

					<p>
						“The recent reports of the Chinese in mining is a clear example of how they disrespect our country. They together with their Ghanaian counters were engaged in the wanton destruction of the environment to make money from illegal mining. The Chinese are also involved in all manner of economic activities including trading, which was the preserve of Ghanaians,” she says.
					</p>

					<p>
						“They are bringing in cheap imports from China and ruining local business. Now local business cannot compete with their prices. The local textile industry is already suffering from cheap Chinese imports Before the Chinese arrived in droves in Ghana, I was used to living with them. My dad worked for 30 Chinese with a Chinese company and we didn’t even notice them around, for the simple reason that they were very professional,” she says.
					</p>

					<p>
						Meanwhile, African countries have been told not to expect job-related skills training from Chinese companies working to build infrastructure in their countries.
					</p>

					<p>
						Stephen Chan, professor of international relations at the School of Oriental Studies in London, told African leaders at the Eighth African Development Forum on South-South relations in (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in October 2012) that they should not expect China to train their citizens in areas in which China has developed expertise because the Chinese did not want Africans to compete with them.
					</p>

					<p>
						Explaining his position to ghanabusinessnews.com he said, “I think that Africa needs more training, but it must be specified to those that are prepared to finance or to provide the assistance for this training.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Very often you get donor countries that don’t provide you with the training that you need partly because they are worried that if they do provide the training that you need, you will become a competitor in the long term with them.”
