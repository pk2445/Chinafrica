						It’s no coincidence that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s second stop on his first tour abroad as the nation’s leader was Africa in March 2013—a continent that has become increasingly important to China economically and commercially.
					</p>

					<p>
						Xi’s mission in Africa was to emphasize China’s “win-win” cooperation with various countries. He did this by signing more than 40 deals with three nations—Tanzania, South Africa and the Republic of Congo—for increased Chinese assistance and more cooperation for infrastructure construction projects.
					</p>

					<p>
						The deals show just how important Africa has become for China as an investment strategy to get oil and other natural resources to continue fueling its growth. The trade volume between China and Africa grew to more than $200 billion last year from $10 billion in 2000, according to Chinese government figures. By the end of 2012, the China had signed bilateral investment treaties with 32 countries and set up joint economic commissions with 45 nations, noted a white paper issued last August by the Information Office of the State Council, or China’s cabinet.

					“There is a dynamic complementarity: China wants oil, natural resources, market entry and influence,” said Jean Kachiga, visiting assistant professor of political science and international relations at the State University of New York Brockport, in an email. “Africa wants investment, infrastructure building, access to Chinese expertise and know-how and markets and welcomes a needed new partner.”
					</p>

					<p>
						The process of investment in Africa begins at the highest level of government with the Central Planning Committee and flows down to the Ministry of Commerce and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), a policy arm of the government that meets every three years in China or an African nation to map out China’s investment strategy on the continent. The FOCAC held its first ministerial conference in October 2000.
					</p>
					<p>
						Chinese interest takes the form of investments through its state-owned enterprises, low interest-rate loans for infrastructure construction projects, grants and trade-offs with nations, which are a mix of development aid and investment in which China offers financing, logistics, personnel and provides companies to do infrastructure building work of infrastructure projects, said Kachiga, author of<i> China in Africa: Articulating China’s Africa Policy</i>. In turn, China receives access to key natural resources, the acquisition of share rights to their extraction, and the exploitation and production of the resources.
					</p>
					
					<p>Five years ago, China’s total trade in goods with sub-Saharan Africa surpassed that of the U.S. Petroleum continues to constitute the majority of U.S. and Chinese imports from the continent, although China is a heavy importer of other natural resources. Likewise, China’s exports to the region far exceed those of the U.S.
				</p>	
					<p>
						Now, more than 2,000 Chinese companies are investing in 50-plus African nations and regions not only in the traditional areas of agriculture, mining and construction but also in resource processing, industrial manufacturing, finance, commercial logistics and real estate, according to the Chinese government’s white paper. Chinese construction companies, in particular, like to do business in Africa because they have a competitive advantage, are more willing to take risks, and face less competition from local companies, said Tang Xiaoyang, assistant professor of international relations and an expert on Sino-African relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
					</p>

					<p>
						Foreign direct investment (FDI) and loans are sometimes included in package deals that also consist of gifts, scholarships, technical assistance and arms sales, said David Shinn, adjunct professor of international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who is an expert on Sino-African relations. He noted that loans for infrastructure projects take precedence over loans for other purposes, because African governments want them and western governments and financial institutions have backed away from support for this in recent years.

						“But it is important to understand that these projects are being paid for by African governments, and China is benefitting because the projects are tied to Chinese companies, materials and some labor,” said Shinn, a former U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso and co-author of <i>China-Africa: A Century of Engagement.</i>
					</p>

					<p>
						China became involved in Africa during the Mao Zedong era (1949-1976), backing liberation movements in various countries in return for diplomatic recognition and support over China’s sworn enemies, the U.S. and former Soviet Union. In those days, the Chinese government provided interest-free loans, such as a nearly 1 billion-yuan loan for the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway in the early 1970s, in exchange for diplomatic recognition.
					</p>

					<p>
						China’s political and diplomatic motives for engaging in Africa increasingly turned into economic ones after <a name="_ftnref12"></a>its reform and opening-up era began in 1979, sparking the start of its economic growth. Since the beginning of this century, China has come to see Africa as an economic partner. Nowadays, China still provides loans but no longer interest-free ones to countries wealthy enough to repay them.

			<p> China has significantly increased its investment in Africa since the early 2000s, following what is known as the “Angola model” where China seals deals in resource-rich nations through loans and credit lines in connection with infrastructure projects, according to Tang. In Angola, now China’s top supplier of African crude oil, the Chinese government financed multimillion-dollar loans for Chinese companies to repair the Benguela Railway running east to west through the country, which was damaged in Angolan civil war (1975-2002).
			</p>

			<p>
				Some critics accuse the Chinese of neo-colonialism in Africa, interpreting their extraction of natural resources such as oil, iron and copper to fuel China’s booming economy in exchange for loans and infrastructure investments as a new form of economic dependency. Large loans for infrastructure projects, using mostly Chinese materials, equipment and labor, go to resource-rich nations that have the funds to repay them.

				China has adopted an approach in Africa that, in theory, is different from that of western countries. It sticks to business and doesn’t dabble to any great extent in the internal political affairs of African countries, despite its heavy involvement in obtaining natural resources and exporting Chinese-made products.In doing business with sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S., for instance, emphasizes the strengthening of democratic institutions and using development assistance to improve health and education. 
			</p>
									
			<p>
				But unlike western countries, Beijing gives aid packages to African countries with no strings attached, according to Sun Yun, an expert on Sino-African relations at The Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy think tank in Washington, D.C.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The intention of China’s aid to Africa is benign but not altruistic,” she wrote in a February commentary. “China does not seek to use aid to influence the domestic politics of African countries or dictate policies. Instead, it truly hopes to help Africa achieve better development while avoiding meddling with the internal affairs of African countries through conditional aid. But on the other hand, China is not helping Africa in exchange for nothing.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Although Chinese officials and many businesspeople would agree that the government’s economic cooperation with certain African nations has been a huge success, some Africans have complained about it. They cite the low quality of work performed by the Chinese, inundation of Chinese goods that hurt local retailers, failure to hire enough local residents to work on projects, and expectations of too much work for too modest pay, Kachiga said.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Strong Chinese commercial competition in Africa has created unhappiness among Africans who operate competitive manufacturing enterprises and African traders who compete head-to-head with Chinese traders,” said Shinn. But he added that on the other hand, many African consumers liked buying cheap Chinese products whose quality is comparable to that of African ones.
